                <h2>Planning & Ideation</h2>
                <p>
                    I work closely with developers and creators to refine game ideas and make sure there's a solid plan
                    in place before we start building. By looking at market trends and spotting opportunities, I help
                    shape unique gameplay mechanics and progression systems that make the game stand out. I also ensure
                    that clear documentation keeps everyone aligned and on the same page.

                <h2>Development & Team Management</h2>
                <p>
                    Turning a game concept into reality means building a strong team and keeping everything running
                    smoothly. I focus on bringing in talented people, assigning tasks effectively, and ensuring that
                    development stays on track.

            <div class="service-card">
                <h2>Marketing & Launch</h2>
                <p>
                    A great game needs the right audience, and that’s where I come in. I focus on building connections
                    through influencer collaborations, community engagement, and smart marketing strategies to maximize
                    visibility. From planning the launch to setting up monetization, I work to ensure the game is
                    positioned for long-term success.

            <div class="service-card">
                <h2>Support & Growth</h2>
                <p>
                    Once the game is live, the work doesn’t stop. I focus on keeping it alive and thriving with regular
                    updates, community interaction, and new ways to grow revenue. By keeping the game fresh with new
                    content and adjusting mechanics based on player feedback, I ensure ongoing engagement.
